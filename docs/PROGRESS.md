- [x] Setup basic PostgreSQL connection scaffolding
- [x] Create database migration system structure
- [x] Setup basic configuration management

### Database Schema
- [x] Port v0.5.0 PostgreSQL schema to migrations
- [x] Create sqlc query files for basic operations
- [ ] Generate Go code with `sqlc generate` (pending PostgreSQL setup)
- [ ] Test database connectivity and basic queries (pending)

### Development Infrastructure  
- [x] CLI tool with Cobra framework
- [x] Basic project documentation
- [x] Docker development environment
- [x] Makefile for development tasks
- [x] Taskfile for task automation
- [x] Configuration management with Viper
- [x] Basic type definitions

## 🔄 In Progress

### Next Steps (Week 2)
- [ ] Setup PostgreSQL test environment
- [ ] Generate sqlc code successfully
- [ ] Complete database connection layer
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Fix compilation errors in db package

## 📊 Current Status

### Working Components
- ✅ CLI tool builds and runs
- ✅ Configuration system functional
- ✅ Project structure established
- ✅ Database migrations defined
- ✅ SQL queries written for sqlc

### Compilation Status
```bash
# CLI tool works
$ ./pgqueue version
PgQueue4Go v0.1.0-dev
Built with Go 1.21+

# Tests partially working
$ go test ./...
ok  github.com/systemquest/pgtask/pkg/config  1.874s
FAIL github.com/systemquest/pgtask/pkg/db [build failed]
```

### Database Schema Status
- PostgreSQL schema migrated from PgQueuer v0.5.0
- All core queries written in sqlc format
- Trigger and notification system defined

## 🎯 Next Phase Goals

### Week 2 Priorities
1. Fix sqlc generation issues
2. Complete database connection layer
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Validate schema against PostgreSQL
5. Complete Phase 1 checklist

### Technical Debt
- Database package compilation errors
- Missing integration tests
- Need sqlc code generation pipeline

## 📈 Migration Alignment

### PgQueuer v0.5.0 Feature Parity
- [x] Database schema structure
- [x] SQL query definitions
- [x] CLI tool framework
- [ ] Working database operations
- [ ] Job lifecycle management

### Architecture Decisions
- ✅ Standard Go project layout
- ✅ sqlc for type-safe database operations
- ✅ pgx for PostgreSQL connectivity
- ✅ Cobra for CLI framework
- ✅ Viper for configuration management

## 🚀 Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Goals
- [x] Project compiles successfully ✅
- [x] CLI tool functional ✅
